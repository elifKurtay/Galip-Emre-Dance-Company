# The-Dance-Company
The Dance Company management application to used in MacOS, made in XCode.
The application has features to arrange financials incomes and outcomes as well as student and class information.
Student attendences are also stored.

Used local file storage instead of a database system because I did not know about databases when I made this project.

## Installation

Add the class files to an MacOS project in XCode.
This is a Cocoa project.

## Usage
Can be used for managing companies but UI and database needs to be modified.
